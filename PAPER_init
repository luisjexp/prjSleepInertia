# Inputs/Factors to assess
Tasks Type 
  - **Assess consistencies accross tasks**
  - **Asses variablity accross tasks**
  - Assess only one task

Subjects/Individuals 
- **Assess variablity between subjects**
- **Assess consitencies accross subjects**

Intervention Type
- assess consistencies between interventions
- assess differences in interventions
- **assess only control** 

Time (ordinal)
- **time 1/single**
- ordinal evolution
- average

Frequency Network
- **consistencies**
- **differences**
- only one band/remove central bands

## Assessments
Fig 1 analysis

Conditional analysis
- slope
- conditional

Distribition/Within Variance analysis



# Data Problems and solutions
**What problems/limitations in tis work, and how can we resolve them, or should we ommit them?**
results accross time highly inconsistent
- lest then  assess t=1
- kanikas argument for the inconsisteny is due to fatigue

Lots of outliers, especially with global measurments
  - already have some good arguments for outliers (see readmes)
  - will assess and focus on individual variance
  - will assess local node data with more power
  - use more robust statistical tests

Temporal confounds of tasks 
  - will have less focus on tasks

Inconsistency of light and control
  - will focus on control rather than light
