# read me, for information about current folder

i was able to successfullt replicate all the original data using my own functions and classes
the code is cleaner and more flexible
i did this to try to understand the code better, which i do now
i can now process the data for any cognitive test (this was orriganlly only for the PVT data set)

Details of replication
- for each combination of condition and subject
	- i replicated the raw psd matrix (ie i organized each subjects psd matrix, given the night and order of being exposed to each condition)
	- I replicated the normalized the psd matrix (ie the psd matrix of all frequencies centered on their mean and scaled by their sd)
	- I replicated the global psd matrix (ie the normalized psd matrix of the 4 frequency bands, averaged accross channels)


you should be able to run the script in this folder to see the replication results. they were exact
all data files, should be accessable to the functions
