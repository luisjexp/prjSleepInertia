this code shows that i replicated the the first part of the plotting funct 22_08_05
i was able to do this using my own version of the code.
including my getglobalpsd function wchich is highly customized,
and my getnework function, which still contains lots of the original code from the extract_wpli function, although with significant modifications

specifically i only replication of the initial variables and analysis under section 'figure 1'
however, the rest of the script (figure 2)  performed the same exact analysis but with the variables psd and mm variables switched

note that this script is not really replicating the results in the main paper,
this is evident in the comparison of psd/strg values during baseline with the AVERAGE of the first two runs
this analysis is not seen in any part of the main paper, nor supplemental methods
