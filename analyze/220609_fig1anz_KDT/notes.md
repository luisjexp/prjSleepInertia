Goal: analyze data using KDT cognitive tests besides PVT

NOTES: what is the purpose of this analysis?
assess the changes in netprops , from baseline,
but what does it mean to have differences between runs? (vs differences form baseline)
    i will ignore these differences since they may not be relvent nor interpretable



FACTORS
- subjects included: All vs some
- DV: global psd, pathl and clustering
- condition: light vs control
- bands: delta theta alpha beta


ANALYSIS 1: INCLUDING ALL SUBJECTS --- 
Global PSD dynamics 
    - control conditions
        - no sig differences between any times in any bands EXCEPT...
        - theta band reduction in GPSD from 1 to 4 
        - beta band: reduction in gpsd from 1 to 2


    - light conditions
        - no signi differences anywhere

    - note that inn both these stests,  subject 7idx has extreme low values during baseline
        brings distribution down and may prevent observing differences

CLUSTER Dynamics 
    - control conditions
        - theta band: significant reduction from 1 to 3
        - alpha: reduction from 2 to 4

    - light conditions
        - no effects any where

    - note that in delta, theta alphta band,  subject 7idx has extreme low values during baseline
        

PATH L DYnamics
    - also subject 7 is an extreme value in many conditions.


SUBJECT 7 analysis (subject id 2962)
    - for all DVs this subject has 'zero' values for baseline.

CONCLUSION
    - will remove subject 7 for this analysis
    - will also remove subject 3
-------------
ANALYSIS 2: REOMOVE OUTLIER SUBJECT 7 AND 3


Global PSD dynamics 
    - control conditions
        - DELTA: no significant differences
            - vs PSD analyis
                - similar becaues no differences from baseline
                - was an increase from 1 to 3 
            
        - THETA: reduction from t1 to t4
            - vs psd analys
                - only one marginally difference between bl and t1
            - interpret: difficult to interpret differences between timepoints
    
           
        - ALPHA: reduction from BL to t4
            - vs psd analysis
                - sig difference between BL and 1, and BL and 2
            - interpration: 
                - this analysis suggests that there was a
                    - reduction in GPSD
                    - observed until T4 (hence no recovery in KDT)!

        - BETA: reduction from BL --> r1, BL --> r2, BL --> r4
            vs psd analysis
                - reduction from BL--> r1, BL--> r2, BL--> r3
            interpret: similar to psd analysis, except no recovery!
    
    -LIGHT CONDITION
        - DELTA: no differences
            - vs pvt analysis: same results, no differences
            - interpret: same results
        - THETA: no differences
            - vs pvt analysis: 
                - difference between t1 vs t2 and t1 vs t4
            - interpret: not sure what to say about this since bot comparing BL
        - ALPHA : diff between BL vs t3,  BL vs t4, t1 and t4, t3 and t4
            - vs pvt analysis
                - diff in BL vs: t1 t3 and t4
            - interpret: similar results, in that there are reductions, but no recovery again
        - BETA: diff in BL vs t1 and BL vs t4
            - vs pvt analysis: nearly identicle results



PATH LENGTH dynamics
    -CONTROL CONDITION: no sig difference anywhere
        - DELTA: no significant differences but appears to trend the same way as in PVT
            - vs pvt analysis
            - interpret
        - THETA: no differences
            - vs pvt analysis: reduction from BL vs T2 and from T1 vs T2 
            - interpret: minor differences, so maybe can pass, 
        - ALPHA : no sig differences
            - vs pvt analysis: same results
            - interpret same results
        - BETA: no sig differences
            - vs pvt analysis same results
            - interpret same results

    -LIGHT CONDITION: no sig difference anywhere in KDT results
        -pvt analysis same except for delta in BL vs t1
        - interpret: kdt data trends the same way

CLUSTERING dynamics
    -CONTROL CONDITION: 
        - DELTA: no significant differences but appears to trend the same way as in PVT

        - THETA: sig diff btwn t1 and t3
            - vs pvt analysis: no sig difference
            - interpret: not important since diff is between t1 and t3 
        - ALPHA : no sig differences
            pvt had same results

        - BETA: no sig differences
            pvt had sig diff between t1 and t3
            interpret: not important because different is not between BL and time points


    -LIGHT CONDITION: no sig difference anywhere in KDT results
        -pvt analysis same except for delta in BL vs t1
        - interpret: kdt data trends the same way


CONCLUSION
could not replicate key results that are needed (the recovery dynamics during delta phases)
although not noted here, i did a wuick run through using the other cognitive tests (math and nogo)
no luck here either
there seems to be too many outliers 
emailed kanika about this.
waiting on here response and will be thinking about other ideas
