% UPDATES


Tested/Validated New Method
I can now run topoplot function to plot eeg topography accross channels.


Added new function....
%     B = removecats(A) removes unused categories from each variable in the
%     table, that is, categories that not are actually present as the value
%     of some element of A.  Usefull instead of manually removing
%     categories from each categorical variable, one by one. Also important
%     to do this when running a regression- in matlab, regressing on a
%     categorical variable with unused categories still includes the
%     categories as predictors in the models
