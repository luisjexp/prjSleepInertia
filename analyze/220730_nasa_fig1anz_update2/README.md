# Validation and figure 1 analysis cleanup
Here i validated and cleaned up figure 1 analysis for the nase a presentation according to what javi and kanika suggested. 
Note that I need to regenerate the google slides for the nasa presentation again.


i wasnt able to replicate the google drive slides i showed kanika and javi for nasa presentation, generated from the prevoious 2 analyses in the folder called 
- prjSleepinertia\analyze\220720_nasa_clust_vs_task_vs_band
- and - prjSleepinertia\analyze\220720_nasa_fig1anz_update
- both analysis are basically the same and both used to create the slides

[See the google slides generated from these analysis here ](PRESENTME.PNG).
- Note the discrepency between slide 4 and 8+9, clustering analysis. 
- The interpretation is wrong, there are no significant effects in ckustering during MATH task ]
- one issue, is that i used the common subjects in both the math and pvt task when generating the the bar graphs in slides 8+9, where as in slide 4, the PVT task had different subjects vs the MATH task. 
- Nevertheless, even if i consider this i cannot replicate the results. 

To see the issue, 
- check out the one of the anaylsis [README here](..\220720_nasa_fig1anz_update\README.MD).
- Or run the the [RUNME.m](..\220720_nasa_fig1anz_update\RUNME.m) script, and note that you cannot replicate the results.
