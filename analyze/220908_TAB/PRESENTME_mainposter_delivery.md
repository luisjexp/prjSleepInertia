# Background
**What is sleep inertia**
Sleep inertia refers to the state of transition between sleep and wake characterized by impaired alertness, confusion, and reduced cognitive and behavioral performance.

**Literature Gaps**
While the neurobehavioral symptoms of sleep inertia are well-described, less is known about
- temporal evolution of small-world network dynamics after waking 
- and the impact of blue-enriched light on this profile
- and the cognitive specificity of these effects


Here we explore the network activity of the waking brain from a graph theoretical perspective. We assess two key network properties after abrupt waking: the clustering coefficient, which measures how likely two network regions are connected to one another, and average path length, which measures the average shortest path between pairs of regions. We also explore how exposure to blue-enriched light attenuates changes clustering and path length as subjects perform two different cognitive tasks to undertand how task demands interacts with these effects.

Comparison for (A) power and (B), (C) brain network properties across test bouts for each
frequency band in the control condition (dim red light). BL = baseline, T#C = Test bout # during the
control condition.

Asterisks represent significant difference on a paired t test without any further
correction applied such that *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Dashed line denotes marginally
significant difference (p = 0.053).

# F1.B PVT Captions
Brain network properties comparing pre-sleep baseline (BL), control at T1 (T1C), and light at T1 (T1L) for (A), (B) the delta frequency band and (C) delta power.  Here, p represents the p value on a paired t test without any further correction applied.

# F1.C PVT Captions
Relationship between the path length and clustering coefficient for the delta frequency band during the PV task. Three slopes are estimated, one for the pre-sleep baseline  (black line), control at T1 (red line), and blue-light at T1. P-values correspond to the significance of interaction coefficient from a linear model that included the pathlength, clustering coefficient, and their interaction.
- all slopes are signifinatly different from zero

- the slope deviates from baseline after waking, but only in the control condition, but the slope under blue light is the same as the slope during presleep (except for the last time point). During the go nogo task, the slope in the delta band deviates from the baseline slope under BOTH the control and blue light conditions, but at delayed time points. The slope of the delta band during the Math task has an 'opposite' behavior than during the PV task:  the slope only changes under the blue light, but never changes under the control condition.

# Discussion


PV task

High frequency changes in global power between pre-sleep and other test bouts are retained during both tasks

Clustering and path length differences between baseline and the test bouts (T1-4) were largely absent in the low frequencies; 

however, within the beta band whilst participants were engaged in the MATH task, we observed a significant change from baseline in T2-4 for both clustering and path length. This effect was largely attenuated with an intervention of blue-enriched light; however, the blue-enriched light intervention also significantly increased clustering coefficient in the delta band above baseline levels. 

Considering the stability of the power effects across tasks and the specificity of the network metrics effects to tasks, these two approaches suggest that two different neural schemes underlying sleep inertia, one that gradually recovers and impacts all that we do (i.e., power) and one that is sensitive to task and intervention, reconfiguring the brain as new task demands emerge.

**effects of sleep inertia**
sleep inertia impacts power during a PV task the same way as during GoNogo task

sleep inertia impacts netowork connectivity (Clustering and path length) during a PV task differently compared to gonogo

**effects of Blue Light**
blue light intervention does not effect power in neither task

blue light intervention effects network connectivity only during the PV task, but not gonogo

**Dependence on Band**
These effects are band specific

two different neural schemes underlying sleep inertia
-  one that gradually recovers and impacts all that we do (i.e., power) (under all types of task demands)
-  one that is sensitive to task and intervention, reconfiguring the brain as new task demands emerge (network connectivity).

Our results suggest that long-range network communication within the brain is crucial to the waking process 
the brain may prioritize these long-range connections during this transitional state. 

Considering the stability of the power effects across tasks and the specificity of the network metrics effects to tasks, these two approaches suggest that two different neural schemes underlying sleep inertia, one that gradually recovers and impacts all that we do (i.e., power) and one that is sensitive to task and intervention, reconfiguring the brain as new task demands emerge.


Our study highlights 
- a novel neurophysiological signature of the awakening brain (network connectivity)
- under different cognitive demands and
- a potential mechanistic explanation for the effect of light in improving performance after waking.

**Power**
 Neural scheme: one that impacts all that we do under all types of task demands and environmental conditions

sleep inertia 
- changes power 
- during a PV task the same way as during GoNogo task

blue light intervention
- does not effect power changes
-  in neither task

**Network Connectivity**
 Neural scheme: that is sensitive to task and intervention reconfiguring the brain as new task demands emerge and environmental conditions

sleep inertia
- impacts netowork connectivity (Clustering and path length) during a PV task differently compared to gonogo

blue light intervention 
- effects network connectivity only during the PV task, but not gonogo


Thus long-range network communication within the brain is crucial to the waking process 
the brain may prioritize these long-range connections during this transitional state.

**significance** 
- a novel neurophysiological signature of the awakening brain (network connectivity)
- under different cognitive demands and
- a potential mechanistic explanation for the effect of light in improving performance after waking.


**Dependence on Band**
These effects are band specific
