**Challenges**


 On-field soldiers, health care personel and surgeons are required to make cognitively-taxing decisions in sleep deprived states or after being abruptly woken up from sleep. In these types of operations, the need for optimizing sleep and returning to full alertness after sleep is critical to mission safety and success.  
 


**Research Question/Technical Goal:** 
What are underlying brain mechanisms causes and behavioral consequences sleep-related phenomena? 
Can we develop methods for soldiers to recover from sleep-deprivation and periods of impaired performance soon after waking personal in order to perform safety-critical tasks.


**Expected impact at completion of project** 
- development neuroscientidic and behavioral theories of sleep related phenomena 
- designing methods to understand how sleep-related issues impacts cogntion, mood, and physical abilities 
- creation of efficient techniques to counter the negative consequenses of sleep-related issues 

**Methodlogy** 
There are no known approaches for systematically assessing and applying neuroscientific-based countermeasures of sleep-related issues in complex military envorimnents.

Assess the negative effects of sleep-distruptions by using
- psychophysical and clinical techniques to measure behavior and cognition
- Virtual reality experiments to mimic real-world operational environments   
- functional magnetic resonant scanning and electo-encelphrography to record brain activity    
- State-of-the-art analytical methods including novel machine learning techniques and graph-networy-theory approaches.

Sleep inertia is a normal phenomenon, but one with potentially dangerous ramifications,

- e.g., in health care workers
    
- or military personnel who are woken abruptly in the night required to make cognitively-taxing decisions [1, 2].

The primary method of counteracting the effects of sleep deprivation is to increase nightly sleep time, which in operational situations is not always feasible. 

This review discusses the need for sleep, effects of sleep deprivation on behaviour and performance in the military, and sleep management recommendations to optimise combat effectiveness. Most people, regardless of sex or race, prefer 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. Sleeping during the day is less recuperative. Continuous sleep is more effective than multiple short naps-even when the total hours for naps is more. Ten to 20 minute naps are useful when continuous sleep is not possible. Sleep inertia is the 5 to 30 minute period of sluggishness after awakening and important military tasks should be avoided. Previously, continuous work episodes (CWEs) duration was restricted by limited night vision, unreliable equipment and reduced endurance of military personnel. With improved technology, CWEs are now restricted primarily by endurance which is affected by sleep deprivation. This was one of the experiences noted in recent conflicts (e.g. Desert Storm) by personnel in the air force, army and navy. Since there will be changes in operational requirements, several work-rest-sleep plans must be prepared. Sleeping the preferred 7 to 8 hours per 24 hours the week before an operation may help prepare for optimal performance. Personnel should be familiarised with conditions under which they may sleep. During combat, sleep management should ideally avoid situations where all personnel are exhausted at the same time. As sleep debt accumulates, a person's mood, motivation, attention, alertness, short-term memory, ability to complete routines, task performance (errors of omission more than errors of commission) and physical performance will become more negatively affected. Counter measures must then be taken (e.g. time for sleep or naps, changing routines or rotating jobs). Drugs like caffeine and amphetamine can help personnel stay awake. However, they may also keep them awake when they need to sleep- and on awakening, they could suffer from "hang-overs" and are less efficient. Sleep lost need not be replaced hour-for-hour. Therefore, after operations, personnel need continuous sleep for only 10 to 12 hours as longer sleep increases sleep inertia and delays getting back to normal schedules.

MINIMIZE SLEEP INERTIA (THAT GROGGY FEELING AFTER A NAP)
• Sleep inertia severely impacts alertness and performance.
• If possible, wait 10-20 minutes after awakening before engaging in critical cognitive tasks.
• If a 10-20 minute delay is not possible, caffeine chewing gum* can reduce sleep inertia in about
5 minutes (quicker than coffee or energy drinks)

THE CHALLENGE
What situations will be encountered
what skills will need to be required
What problems need to tackled 
What are the current issues with current methods


**The Challenge**
Soldiers and squads will be teamed with increasingly sophisticated and evolving technologies. Soldiers and leaders will require increased technological aptitudes and skills in order to adapt emerging technologies to evolving mission sets and avoid being overmatched by AI-enabled â€œsmartâ€ technologies.

<u>Research Question/Technical Goal</u>
Can the ability of Soldiers and units to use and rapidly adapt novel and intelligent technologies without formal training on specific technologies (â€œTechnological Fluencyâ€) be modeled, assessed, and enhanced?
  
<u>Collaborators</u>
Army Research Institute, ColumbiaU, GWU, DCS Corp 

Area Leaders: AFRL, ARI, MIT Media Lab, ColumbiaU, Rice

**Expected outcomes**

<u> Expected impact at completion of project</u>:
 Enable the creation of a â€œtechnologically fluentâ€ Force by developing models of technological fluency (TF), methods to assess and develop the TF of Soldiers, and technologies to maximize TF resilience and performance in Soldiers and units.

**Methodology**
There are no known approaches for systematically assessing, developing, and tracking technological fluency in a workforce.

Leveraging previous research: E.g., cognitive science (TF Modeling); human psychometrics (TF Personnel Assessment); and human education, training, and cueing (Maximizing TF).

Leveraging ongoing research efforts to support all TF efforts: holistic personnel assessment and leader development; opportunistic data interpretation; human-autonomy teaming.
