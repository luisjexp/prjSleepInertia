Reconfigurations in brain networks upon awakening from slow wave sleep: Interventions and
implications in neural communication


One sentence summary
Blue-enriched light partially accelerates the rapid prioritization of long-range communication
within the human brain that characterizes sleep inertia



# Original Abstract

INTRO: DEFINITION
Sleep inertia is the brief period of impaired alertness and performance experienced immediately
after waking. 


INTRO: LIT GAP 
While the neurobehavioral symptoms of sleep inertia are well-described, less is
known about the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. 


A better understanding of the neural processes during sleep inertia may offer insight into the cognitive impairments observed
and the awakening process generally. 

METHODS
- We observed brain activity following abrupt awakening from slow wave sleep during the biological night. 

Using electroencephalography (EEG) and a network science approach, we evaluated
- power, clustering coefficient, and path length 
- across frequency bands 
- under both a control condition and a blue-enriched light intervention condition 
- in a within-subject design. 

RESULTS
we found that under control conditions, 
- the awakening brain is typified by an immediate reduction in global theta, alpha, and beta power. 

Simultaneously, we observed 
- a decrease in the clustering coefficient 
- and an increase in path length within the delta band.

Exposure to blue-enriched light immediately after awakening
-  ameliorated these changes
- but only for clustering. 

INTERPRETATION
Our results suggest that 
- long-range network communication within the brain is crucial to the waking process 
- and that the brain may prioritize these long-range connections during this transitional state. 

SIGNIFICANCE
Our study 
- highlights a novel neurophysiological signature of the awakening brain 
- and provides a potential mechanistic explanation for the effect of light in improving performance after waking.
